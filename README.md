# TONDC-3DP
 Tonbridge School 3D Printers

If you need guidance to get started with 3D Printing, consult the Guidance folder and read the instructions.

For advanced users/modders, the department has 3 creality machines for this purpose, all of which are heavily modified and are running klipper firmware. If you are interested in learning but do not yet know where to start, I would advice watching the Teaching Tech youtube channel, and gaining a basic understanding of Klipper firmware. The best way to do this is by follwoing the guidance within Guidance/KlipperFW/readme.md

Guides/changelogs for each machiene can be found in the printer's respective folder. Each folder is broken down into hardware and firmware sections. Follow the instructions in each folder for assistance. If you plan to make upgrades, please familiarise yourself with GitHub and pull requests first. You can then consult Chris Walker/Lucas Dobson with your proposals, and modify this github through submitting a pull request with the apropriate changes made. Please do not disregard this crucial step, as elsewise critical documentation for future users is lost. Thank You for your co-operation.
